If `masscan` is not installed on your Kali system, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install masscan
```

## Basic Usage

The general syntax for `masscan` is:

```bash
masscan [options] <target>
```

### Common Options

- `-p`: Specify the port or port range to scan (e.g., `-p80` or `-p1-100`).
- `-iL`: Input from a list of targets from a file.
- `-oG`: Output results in grepable format.
- `--rate`: Specify the packet sending rate (e.g., `--rate=1000`).
- `-sS`: Use SYN scan (this is the default).

## Examples

### 1. Scanning a Single IP

To scan a specific IP address for open port 80:

```bash
masscan -p80 192.168.1.1
```

### 2. Scanning a Range of IPs

To scan a range of IPs (e.g., from `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.254`) for open ports 1-1000:

```bash
masscan -p1-1000 192.168.1.1/24
```

### 3. Scanning an Entire Subnet

To scan an entire subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`) for port 22:

```bash
masscan -p22 10.0.0.0/8
```

### 4. Saving Output

To save the scan results in a grepable format:

```bash
masscan -p80 -oG output.txt 192.168.1.0/24

                                                  ALTERNATIVE
The `masscan` tool is a powerful network scanning tool that can be used on Kali Linux to perform fast port scans on a large number of IP addresses. Here's how you can use `masscan` and some examples of its usage:

1. **Scanning a single IP address**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.100 -p80,443
   ```
   This will scan the IP address `192.168.1.100` and check for open ports 80 and 443.

2. **Scanning a range of IP addresses**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.1-254 -p80,443
   ```
   This will scan the entire `192.168.1.0/24` subnet and check for open ports 80 and 443.

3. **Scanning a network using CIDR notation**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p80,443
   ```
   This is similar to the previous example, but uses CIDR notation to specify the network range.

4. **Scanning a list of IP addresses from a file**:
   ```
   masscan -iL ip_list.txt -p80,443
   ```
   This will scan the IP addresses listed in the `ip_list.txt` file and check for open ports 80 and 443.

5. **Increasing the scan rate**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.1-254 -p80,443 --rate 10000
   ```
   This will increase the scan rate to 10,000 packets per second, which can be useful for faster scans.

6. **Saving the scan results to a file**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.1-254 -p80,443 -oB output.bin
   ```
   This will save the scan results in binary format to the `output.bin` file, which can be useful for later analysis.

7. **Performing a TCP SYN scan**:
   ```
   masscan 192.168.1.1-254 -p80,443 --tcp-connect
   ```
   This will perform a TCP SYN scan, which is a more thorough scan than the default UDP scan.

`masscan` is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of network scanning tasks, from basic port scans to more advanced network mapping and vulnerability identification. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice among security professionals and network administrators.

                                               ALTERNATIVE
Masscan is a powerful and very fast network port scanner. Here's how it's used on Kali Linux, along with examples:

**1. Installation**

*   Masscan often comes pre-installed on Kali Linux. You can check by running `masscan` in the terminal.
*   If it's not installed, you can install it using these commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install masscan
    ```
*   Alternatively, you can install it from the source code:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install clang git gcc make libpcap-dev
    git clone https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
    cd masscan
    sudo make
    ```

**2. Basic Usage**

*   To see the basic options, just run `masscan` without any arguments.

**3. Key Features and Functionality**

*   **Speed:** Masscan is designed for rapid scanning, potentially scanning the entire internet in under 6 minutes. It achieves this through asynchronous transmission and a custom TCP/IP stack.
*   **Flexibility:** It allows for arbitrary IP ranges and port ranges.
*   **Nmap-like Output:**  The output format is similar to Nmap, making it familiar to many users.
*   **Custom TCP/IP Stack:** Masscan uses its own TCP/IP stack. Because of this, anything beyond a simple port scan might conflict with the local TCP/IP stack.

**4. Examples**

*   **Single Port Scan:**

    ```bash
    sudo masscan <target IP> -p<port number>
    #Example: sudo masscan 172.217.167.46 -p443
    ```

    This scans the specified IP address for port 443.
*   **Multiple Port Scan:**

    ```bash
    sudo masscan <target IP> -p<port1>,<port2>,<port3>
    #Example: sudo masscan 172.217.167.46 -p443,80,4444
    ```

    This scans the specified IP address for ports 443, 80, and 4444.
*   **Range of Ports:**

    ```bash
    sudo masscan <target IP> -p<start port>-<end port>
    #Example: sudo masscan 172.217.167.46 -p12-443
    ```

    This scans the specified IP address for ports ranging from 12 to 443.
*   **Scanning a Subnet:**

    ```bash
    masscan <IP address>/24 -p443
    #Example: masscan 192.168.43.0/24 -p443
    ```

    This scans the entire class C subnet for port 443.
*   **Scanning Multiple Ports on a Subnet:**

    ```bash
    masscan <IP address>/24 -p80,443,20,21
    #Example: masscan 192.168.43.0/24 -p80,443,20,21
    ```

    This command scans the whole class C subnet for ports 20, 21, 80, and 443.
*   **Scanning a Range of Ports on a Subnet:**

    ```bash
    masscan <IP address>/24 -p20-150
    #Example: masscan 192.168.43.0/24 -p20-150
    ```

    This command scans the whole class C subnet for ports starting from 20 up to 150.
*   **Scanning Top Ports:**

    ```bash
    masscan <IP address>/24 --top-ports 100
    #Example: masscan 192.168.43.0/24 --top-ports 100
    ```

    This command scans from a pre-written list of top ports.
*   **Modifying the Speed:**

    ```bash
     masscan <IP address>/24 -p80 --rate 100000
     #Example: masscan 192.168.43.0/24 -p80 --rate 100000
    ```

    The default speed is around 100 packets per second, but you can increase it.
*   **Banner Grabbing:**

    ```bash
    masscan 23.0.0.0/0 -p80 --banners --output-format binary --output-filename internet.scan
    ```

**5. Important Considerations**

*   **Firewalling:**  If you're doing more than simple port scans, you might need to configure your system to firewall the ports Masscan uses or use the `-S` option to use a separate IP address to avoid conflicts with the local TCP/IP stack.
*   **Legal Issues:** Be careful when scanning. Scanning networks without permission is illegal.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Use rate limiting (`--rate`) to avoid overwhelming the target network and potentially getting blocked.

Masscan is a powerful tool for network reconnaissance, especially when speed is crucial. Remember to use it responsibly and ethically.

                                                         ALTERNATIVE
Masscan is a powerful and fast TCP port scanner that is included in Kali Linux. It is designed to scan large networks quickly, capable of scanning the entire Internet in under six minutes at a rate of up to 25 million packets per second. Here’s how to use Masscan effectively, along with some examples.

### Installation
Masscan is typically pre-installed in Kali Linux. If it is not available, you can install it using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install masscan
```
This command will also handle any necessary dependencies automatically [[1]](https://www.kali.org/tools/masscan/).

### Basic Usage
Masscan's usage is similar to that of Nmap, but it operates asynchronously, making it significantly faster. The basic syntax for using Masscan is:
```bash
masscan [options] <target>
```

### Common Commands and Examples

1. **Scanning Specific Ports on a Subnet**:
   To scan for specific ports (e.g., 22, 80, and 445) across a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24):
   ```bash
   masscan -p22,80,445 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   This command will initiate a SYN stealth scan and report any open ports found [[1]](https://www.kali.org/tools/masscan/).

2. **Scanning a Range of Ports**:
   To scan a range of ports (e.g., from 12 to 443) on a specific IP address:
   ```bash
   masscan -p12-443 <target_ip>
   ```

3. **Scanning All Ports**:
   To scan all 65535 ports on a target:
   ```bash
   masscan -p0-65535 <target_ip>
   ```

4. **Increasing Scan Speed**:
   By default, Masscan scans at a rate of 100 packets per second. To increase the speed, use the `--rate` option:
   ```bash
   masscan -p80 --rate 250000 <target_ip>
   ```
   This command sets the scan rate to 250,000 packets per second [[2]](https://www.kalilinux.in/2020/09/masscan-1000-times-faster-than-nmap.html).

5. **Scanning the Entire Internet**:
   To scan the entire Internet for a specific port (e.g., port 443):
   ```bash
   masscan 0.0.0.0/0 -p443
   ```
   However, be cautious as this can lead to being banned by some networks [[2]](https://www.kalilinux.in/2020/09/masscan-1000-times-faster-than-nmap.html).

6. **Output Formats**:
   Masscan allows you to save the output in various formats, such as:
   - XML: `-oX output.xml`
   - Grepable: `-oG output.gnmap`
   - JSON: `-oJ output.json`

7. **Pausing and Resuming Scans**:
   You can pause a scan by pressing `CTRL+C`, which saves the current state to a file (paused.conf). To resume, use:
   ```bash
   masscan -c paused.conf
   ```

### Important Considerations
- Masscan uses its own TCP/IP stack, which can lead to conflicts with the local stack if not configured properly. It is recommended to run Masscan with a separate IP address or configure firewall rules to avoid issues [[3]](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan).
- Unlike Nmap, Masscan does not check if a host is up before scanning, so it may report open ports on hosts that are actually down [[2]](https://www.kalilinux.in/2020/09/masscan-1000-times-faster-than-nmap.html).

### Conclusion
Masscan is an efficient tool for network scanning, especially for large networks. Its speed and flexibility make it a valuable asset for network administrators and security professionals.
